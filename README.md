# Micro-Project 
Micro-service architecture project. In the example demonstrates use of MongoDB, RabbitMQ, MySQL, Python, Docker, and Kubernetes.
## Issues
Had a few issues with communicating between pods and resolving host name errors.
## Fixes
Had to edit etc/hosts on client machine in order to be able to resolve the host name errors and had to double check and error correct config files for Docker containers.
